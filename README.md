# Kernel Methods for Machine Learning
The goal of the data challenge is to learn how to implement machine learning algorithms from scratch and to acquire a better understanding of these techniques by adapting them to structural data. We consider a sequence classification task: predicting whether or not a DNA sequence region is a binding site to a specific transcription factor.
